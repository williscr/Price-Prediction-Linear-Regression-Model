***Installation***

The neccessary libraries required to run the code are : 

numpy

pandas 

matplotlib.pyplot

sklearn.linear_model LinearRegression 

sklearn.pipeline Pipeline and make_pipeline 

sklearn.preprocessing StandardScaler

sklearn.model_selection train_test_split

sklearn.metrics r2_score and mean_squared_error

seaborn 

scipy.stats 

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

***Project Motivation***

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data, an open data source from Kaggle.

I was interested in answering the questions :

1) Which features of the seatle dataset are most useful in predicting the price ? 

2) Can we train a classifier to predict the price ?

3) What neighbourhood in seattle is the cheapest to rent a listing ?

This will help me understand, the listings data and gain hands on experience using real messy data to practice my data science skills. 


***File Descriptions***

There are 1 notebook available here that answers questions related to the above questions.
This notebook follows the CRISP-DM data science process to answer the project questions. 
Markdown cells guide in the structure and the individual steps and outline the proccess taken. 
The file name is : Price Predictor - Module 1.ipynb

The data source is also committed to this repository. 
The file name is: Seattle_Data.zip

***Results***

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available at :

The results are also described throughout the mark down cells in the notebook.
