**Installation

The neccessary libraries required to run the code are : 

numpy
pandas 
matplotlib.pyplot
sklearn.linear_model LinearRegression 
sklearn.pipeline Pipeline and make_pipeline 
sklearn.preprocessing StandardScaler
sklearn.model_selection train_test_split
sklearn.metrics r2_score and mean_squared_error
seaborn 
scipy.stats 

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

**Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data, an open data source from Kaggle.

I was interested in answering the questions : 

1) What features are most valueable in predicting the price ?

2) How can we predict the price of an air bnb using numeric and categoric data in the data set ? 

3) What neighbourhood in seattle is the cheapest to rent a listing ?

This will help me understand, the listings data , gain hands on experience using real messy data to practice my data science skills. 

**File Descriptions

There are 1 notebook available here that answers questions related to the above questions. This notebook follows the CRISP-DM data science process. 
Markdown cells guide in the structure and the individual steps.  

The data source is also committed to this repository.

**Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.

**Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Must give credit to Kaggle and airbnb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle

Concepts used in this notebook have been derived from module 2 of the udacity data science nano degree. 
I also gained inspiration for this project from kaggles open data code discussion.
